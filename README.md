## Directory Structure

Here's an overview of the main directories in a typical Laravel application:

- **`app/`**: Contains the core code of your application, including models, controllers, providers, and console commands.
- **`bootstrap/`**: Contains files that bootstrap the framework and configure autoloading.
- **`config/`**: Stores all of your application's configuration files.
- **`database/`**: Holds your database migrations, model factories, and seeds.
- **`public/`**: The web server's document root and the entry point for all requests via `index.php`. This directory also houses publicly accessible assets like compiled CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- **`resources/`**: Contains your views (Blade templates), raw assets (LESS, SASS, JavaScript), and language files.
- **`routes/`**: Defines all the routes for your application (web, API, console).
- **`storage/`**: Stores compiled Blade templates, file-based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework.
- **`tests/`**: Contains your automated tests (feature and unit tests).
- **`vendor/`**: Holds your Composer dependencies.

## Features

### Product Management
- Manage products within the application.
- It utilizes a `Product` model to store product information.
- Users can view a list of all products at the `/products` page.
- Detailed information for each product can be accessed via pages like `/products/{id}` (e.g., `/products/1`).

### User Authentication
- The application provides a complete user authentication system.
- Users can register, login, and logout.
- It includes features like password reset and email verification.

### User Roles
- The application supports different user roles (e.g., admin, user).
- Role-based access control can be implemented to restrict access to certain features or sections of the application based on user roles.

## Running the Development Server

To run the basic development server, use the following Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

For a more comprehensive development environment, which includes starting the PHP development server, running the queue worker, and compiling assets with Vite, use the `dev` script from `composer.json`:

```bash
composer run dev
```

## Running Tests

To execute the application's automated tests, use the following Composer script:

```bash
composer test
```

This command conveniently runs the test suite, which by default utilizes Pest and executes `php artisan test` internally.

This includes tests for the Product Management feature, such as:
- `tests/Feature/Products/ProductPageTest.php`
- `tests/Unit/ProductTest.php`
